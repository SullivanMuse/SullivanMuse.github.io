If you ask most people what modernism or postmodernism means, most will have no idea. Those that think they have an idea will say something like "postmodernism is the rejection of objective truth." This isn't the real answer. Below I will give some models for how I think about modernism and postmodernism that hold up in a variety of contexts.

| Philosophy | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Modernism | The cultural consequences and narratives arising from empiricism.
| Postmodernism | The cultural consequences of skepticism towards empiricsm, and skepticism towards narrative itself.
| Metamodernism | A response to postmodernism. Reconciles postmodernism and modernism. Can be thought of in the Hegelian sense as a synthesis.

To be clear here, postmodernism does not reject empiricism outright. It seeks to question its vice-grip on the early 20th century.
